## What is wcioShop
An e-commerce solution focused on speed and reliability. Long story short, the first version of this system was built in 4 days of nonstop coding (YES I did not sleep for days coding the first version in 2010). 
This system has been in use since 2010, but has never been made public. This GitHub project will fix that. I will be making a lot of changes to this before adding files to GitHub. If you see this message, the project is not ready for use. 

If you want to read the long version of why and how I coded this in 4 days originally, then head over to Discussions 

## Requirements
- PHP 8 (Developed on PHP 8.x, might work on older versions)
- Apache 2.4+ web server
- A valid and working SSL certificate. Any error due to a missing SSL will not be fixed. With the availability of free SSL Let's Encrypt, there is no reason not to have it.

## FAQ
#### Is there a live demo

Here is the demo store:
- Shop live site: https://kimvinberg.dk

### What is catalog mode / full shop mode
Catalog mode is a catalog only. no purchasing is possible. Prices and stock status is not displayed by default (but can be). Full shop mode is a fully working site with purchasing.

## Want to help?
If you want to help, I would like any help I can get.

* Coding help:
Help in making custom apps like payment gateways, shipping stuff, and accounting sync would be useful as code debugging of the system. Currently, there is no need for more people to work on the core itself because it's not ready to be used.

* Design:
If you want to, it could use a pretty store theme that can be downloaded. Must be your own design and code.

* Translation:
I haven't really looked much into how to translate this yet, will be looked into when it's ready for use I guess. But if you want to translate, let me know.

* Testing:
If you want to help test this out, open an issue and I will contact you (not everything is uploaded here yet, so I might have more ready that is not yet visible). IT can be maybe just a specific function or something. 


## Themes
There will be a default theme (not pretty, but functional. Check the live demo. You can, of course, create your own easily and do what you want. 

## Documentation
There will be made several documentations. All can be found at the link below:
