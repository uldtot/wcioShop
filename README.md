## What is wcioShop
An e-commerce solution focused on speed and reliability. Long story short, the first version of this system was built in 4 days of nonstop coding (YES I did not sleep for days coding the first version in 2010). 
This system has been in use since 2010 but never made public, this GitHub project will fix that. I will be making a lot of changes to this before adding files to GitHub. If you see this message, the project is not ready for use. 

If you want to read the long version of why and how i  coded this in 4 days originally, then hed over to Discussions 

## Requirements
- PHP 8 (Developed on PHP 8.x, might work on older versions)
- Apache 2.4+ web server
- A valid and working SSL certificate. Any error due to missing SSL will not be fixed. With the availability of free SSL LeetsEncrypt, there are no reason not to have it.

## FAQ

### What is catalog mode / full shop mode
Catalog mode is a catalog only, no purchasing is possible. Prices and stock status is not displayed by default (but can be). Full shop mode is a fully working site with purchasing.
