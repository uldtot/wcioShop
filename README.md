# wcioShop
A ecommerce solution focused on speed and reliability. Long story short, the first version of this system was built in 4 day non stop coding (YES i did not sleep for days coding the first version in 2010). 
This system have been in use since 2010 but never made public, this github project will fix that. I will be making a lot of changes to this before adding files to GitHub. If you see this message, the project is not ready for use. 

## Requirements
- PHP 7.4+ (Developed on PHP 7.4 and PHP 8, might work on older versions)
- Apache 2.4+ web server (Should work on NGINX or LiteSpeed but without the .htaccess)
- A valid and working SSL certificate

## PHP 8
This should work with PHP 8.

There is a non working site here: https://shop.kundesider.dk/ - But this is NOT a demo for this project. A real demo will be available in future.
