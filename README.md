## What is wcioShop
An e-commerce solution focused on speed and reliability. Long story short, the first version of this system was built in 4 days nonstop coding (YES I did not sleep for days coding the first version in 2010). 
This system has been in use since 2010 but never made public, this GitHub project will fix that. I will be making a lot of changes to this before adding files to GitHub. If you see this message, the project is not ready for use. 

## Requirements
- PHP 8 (Developed on PHP 8.x, might work on older versions)
- Apache 2.4+ web server (Should work on NGINX or LiteSpeed but without the .htaccess)
- A valid and working SSL certificate

## FAQ
#### Is there a live demo

Here is the demo store:
- Shop live site: https://kimvinberg.dk

### What is catalog mode / full shop mode
Catalog mode is a catalog only, no purchasing is possible. Prices and stock status is not displayed by default (but can be). Full shop mode is a fully working site with purchasing.

## Want to help?
If you want to help, I would like any help I can get.
This can be coding, design, translation, testing, and I'm sure a lot more.

## Themes
Currently, there is no plan to make a default theme with all functions included. 
What you see on the live site example is just to show what can be done.

## Documentation
There will be made several documentations. All can be found at link below:
