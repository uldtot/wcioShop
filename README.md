# wcioShop
A ecommerce solution focused on speed and reliability. Long story short, the first version of this system was built in 4 day non stop coding (YES i did not sleep for days coding this). 
This system have been in use for since 2013 but never made public, this github project will fix that. I will be making a lot of changes to this before adding files to GitHub. If you see this message, the project is not ready for use. 

## Requirements
- PHP 7.4+ (Developed on PHP 7.4)
- Apache 2.4+ web server (Should work on NGINX or LiteSpeed but without the .htaccess)
- A valid and working SSL certificate

## FAQ
#### Is there a live demo
There is a non working site here: https://shop.kundesider.dk/ - But this is NOT a demo for this project. A real demo will be available in future.

#### When can i expect this to be ready for use? 
Cannot say at the moment.

#### Will this be free to use?
Yes and no. All source code for the first version will be published here on GitHub. 
The will be some extensions for sale later and a hosted solution of this for those who do not want to host themself.
