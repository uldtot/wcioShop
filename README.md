## What is wcioShop
A e-commerce solution focused on speed and reliability. Long story short, the first version of this system was built in 4 days nonstop coding (YES I did not sleep for days coding the first version in 2010). 
This system has been in use since 2010 but never made public, this GitHub project will fix that. I will be making a lot of changes to this before adding files to GitHub. If you see this message, the project is not ready for use. 

## Requirements
- PHP 7.4+ (Developed on PHP 7.4 and PHP 8, might work on older versions)
- Apache 2.4+ web server (Should work on NGINX or LiteSpeed but without the .htaccess)
- A valid and working SSL certificate

## PHP 8
This should work with PHP 8. 

## FAQ
#### Is there a live demo

Here is the demo store:

### What is catalog mode / full shop mode
Catalog mode is a catalog only, no purchasing is possible. Prices and stock status is not displayed by default (but can be). Full shop mode is a fully working site with purchasing.
